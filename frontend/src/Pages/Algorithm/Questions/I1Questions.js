      "Treatment Protocol: \nMinor-Care Protocol for breast pain. Women with a large amount of breast tissue can have discomfort associated with stretching of Cooperâ€™s ligaments. It can be associated with shoulder, back, or neck pain and made worse with exercise. Educate the Soldier on the importance of supportive undergarments, ice compress/heat compress for inflammation, acetaminophen as needed for mild pain, and ibuprofen (1st line) or ketorolac (2nd line) as needed for moderate pain. \nMCP for chest extramammary/musculoskeletal pain. Related to the chest wall and not the breast tissue. Ice/ heat compresses as needed for inflammation. Medication: mentyl salicylate (1st line) or acetaminophen (2nd line) as needed for mild pain, and ibuprofen (1st line) or ketorolac (2nd line) as needed for moderate pain. Activity modifications should be considered as appropriate. \nMCP for diffuse breast pain. Diffuse breast pain is unlikely to be related to cancer. Provide reassurance. If the Soldier is concerned about the possibility of breast cancer after reassurance, refer to provider for consideration of an imaging study to provide reassurance. Treat discomfort with ice/heat (1st line) or acetaminophen (2nd line) as needed for mild pain and ibuprofen (1st line) or ketorolac (2nd line) as needed for moderate pain.",

      "Breast pain can represent musculoskeletal pain, cyclic pain, or pain associated with inflammation or infection. It is rarely associated with cancer. \nDP 1: Skin changes, mass, or bloody nipple discharge are concerning symptoms that require further evaluation and imaging. Red, swollen breast can represent mastitis or an abscess that requires further evaluation and treatment. \nDP 2: Testosterone supplementation in exercise supplements can result in enlargement of breast tissue under the nipple. Enlarged breast tissue can be painful, especially when wearing body armor, further evaluation and counseling are warranted. Nursing mothers often have problems with cracked or infected nipples or have difficulty when the child is weaned, but further examination is required to rule out more concerning issues. Pain without other concerns that is not related to breastfeeding weaning, exercise, or cyclical pain with menstrual cycle requires further evaluation and may require imaging.",
