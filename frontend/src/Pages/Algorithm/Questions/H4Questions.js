      "Double vision means seeing two images of a single object. \nDP 1. Assess for potential life-threatening injuries (head, neck, and airway) before accessing for vision issues. If the double vision is related to a recent trauma to the head, neck, or back, then it may represent a serious injury to the brain. Neurologic deficits (trouble walking, talking) can indicate a serious problem requiring immediate evaluation. \nDP 2.

If double vision continues despite having one eye shut or if double vision is a new issue, the Soldier will need to be referred to an eye care provider (ophthalmologist or optometrist).",
