      "Hypothermia, or a lower than normal body temperature, can be the result of heat loss from exposure to cold or wet environments, inadequate heat production due to poor nutrition or exhaustion, or inaccurate heat regulation from using drugs such as nicotine, alcohol, and medications with anticholinergic side effects. \nDP 1. Mild hypothermia presents with T 90-95oF, normal mental status, tachycardia, tachypnea, and shivering. Moderate hypothermia presents with T 82-90oF, lethargy, bradycardia with arrhythmias, and hypoventilation without shivering. Severe hypothermia presents with T <82oF, coma, asystole, and apnea so that the Soldier may appear dead but resuscitation is still possible. Note any discrepancy between the extent of an abnormal vital sign and the degree of hypothermia may represent an underlying alternate cause for the vital sign abnormality like a head injury for confusion or hypovolemia for tachycardia. Frostbite may appear white or grayish-yellow and be hard or waxy to the touch. Support the Soldierâ€™s airway, breathing, circulation, start two large bore IVs with warmed fluids, remove wet clothes, use body heat, blankets, and space/hypothermia blanket to rewarm, and transport horizontally. Low exertion of peripheral muscles can result in further drop in temperature. \nDP 2. Symptoms of hypothermia with a normal temperature suggests an alternative diagnosis. Opioids, behavioral health medications, and alcohol can include medications for anxiety, depression, antipsychotics can impair thermoregulation. Severe pain associated with a nonfreezing cold injury requires further evaluation and management. \nDP 3. See Protocol K-3 for immersion foot. Immersion foot usually results when the skin is exposed to wet, cold foot gear or from immersion at temperatures from 32oF to 59oF for over two to three days (nonfreezing cold injury (NFCI) or immersion foot) and presents with a white, wrinkled, numb, painless extremity.",
